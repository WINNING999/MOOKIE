# MOOKIE : Did you ever hear the concept of the Internet or the Matrix running on not only 1 & 0's but also 11 & 00 which are existing keys. Then add in possibly roman numerals so II and x and y which could unlock numerous language keys. How about if the zeroes were like a linear UPC which has all the zeroes replaced with ? and/or removed to bring the remaining numbers together and auto add the first digit around to be the now final number and correct to a specific number of characters thus leaving no zeroes for the Internet/matrix to compute. Which "0" is the integer between numbers as it exists and doesn't exist in any POMAD equation that would work out to absolute zero. ZERO = 8e2!
How about when you incorporate the idea that 11 and 111 would also adapt in there and the possibility Y2K is a really a thing and has been getting fixed by auto correction and could be a thing along with needing to check about times where coding corrections are or were implemented to reduce computations and to increase performance not on purpose obviously. Make sure you share this, Just send it. There is no way anyone would keep this to themselves and since I believe it to be my sole intellectual property it will forever be free to be utilized by anyone and everyone from this point forward.

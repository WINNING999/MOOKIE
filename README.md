# MOOKIE : Did you ever hear the concept of the Internet or the Matrix running on not only 1 & 0's but also 11 & 00 which are existing keys. Then add in possibly roman numerals so II and x and y which could unlock numerous language keys. How about if the zeroes were like a linear UPC which has all the zeroes replaced with ? and/or removed to bring the remaining numbers together and auto add the first digit around to be the now final number and correct to a specific number of characters thus leaving no zeroes for the Internet/matrix to compute. Which "0" is the integer between numbers as it exists and doesn't exist in any POMAD equation that would work out to absolute zero. ZERO = 8e2!
How about when you incorporate the idea that 11 and 111 would also adapt in there and the possibility Y2K is a really a thing and has been getting fixed by auto correction and could be a thing along with needing to check about times where coding corrections are or were implemented to reduce computations and to increase performance not on purpose obviously. Make sure you share this, Just send it. There is no way anyone would keep this to themselves and since I believe it to be my sole intellectual property it will forever be free to be utilized by anyone and everyone from this point forward.
You know how to use this for coding and scripting and the open use is extended to any Computer ever past current and future. This completes the communication gap and will allow seemless perfect interaction and corrections from the beginning of Infinity up to the most finite existence possible and with the addition of allowing for the known negatives to be fragmented on our DNA coding we can remember the bad times not ever completely forget them but choose to have them archived as ? to be defragged and used a celebration of life.
You get credit for this one. Just ask old Marianus trench Internet if they know anything about it. Especially the roman numerals and mention that sign language is all hand gestures that are either fingers (1) or forming an "O" or possibly a "0" or an "O0" "00" "OO. The letter "O" looks very similar to the number "0".
Since π doesn't have any 0's I believe could that also be a system correction when eliminating the zeroes and with the whole number being "3" and non divisible it into itself would create a never ending number that would end each run with the number that falls in place from the nightmare that that must be. π=whole milk (ala mode)
Mathematics cannot be the universal language with this in place as it would always leave a question in place about whatever interacts with it. In this case pretty much everything that has to do with astro physics any math from geometry on. Add in the additional coding theories within a sandbox with screenshots of the environment get taken constantly and cold storage archived versions for backup in general and any persons DNA should have everything ever stored on it and downloadable. If the answer ever existed before it's on our hard drive. Seriously. The roman numerals will account for coordinates and chromosomes in other applications.

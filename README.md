# MOOKIE : Did you ever hear the concept of the Internet or the Matrix running on not only 1 & 0's but also 11 & 00 which are existing keys. Then add in possibly roman numerals so II and x and y which could unlock numerous language keys. How about if the zeroes were like a linear UPC which has all the zeroes replaced with ? and/or removed to bring the remaining numbers together and auto add the first digit around to be the now final number and correct to a specific number of characters thus leaving no zeroes for the Internet/matrix to compute. Which "0" is the integer between numbers as it exists and doesn't exist in any POMAD equation that would work out to absolute zero. ZERO = 8e2!
